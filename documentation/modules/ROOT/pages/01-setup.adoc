During this tutorial, will be required to work with different tools for running the exercises included. Please install the following software:

include::partial$requirements.adoc[]

NOTE: Please review the official documentation to install the latest versions of these tools on your laptop following the optimum procedure 

It is also required to have a https://github.com[GitHub] account in order to create some repositories during this tutorial.

[#01-laboratory]
== Laboratory

The technical exercises included in this tutorial are based on cloud native solutions which are extensively used in the IT market. Please review the following list which includes the basics around these cloud native solutions:

- https://github.com/[GitHub] is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.
- https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/[Red Hat Openshift Container Platform Cluster] is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform with full-stack automated operations to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments. Red Hat OpenShift is optimized to improve developer productivity and promote innovation.
- https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/[ArgoCD] is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes following the GitOps pattern of using Git repositories as the source of truth for defining the desired application state. Argo CD automates the deployment of the desired application states in the specified target environments. Application deployments can track updates to branches, tags, or pinned to a specific version of manifests at a Git commit.
- https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/[Argo Rollouts] provides advanced deployment capabilities such as blue-green, canary, canary analysis, experimentation, and progressive delivery features to Kubernetes.
- https://helm.sh/[Helm] is a tool to find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes. Helm helps users manage Kubernetes applications in terms of definition, installing, and upgrading even the most complex Kubernetes applications.


During this tutorial, a set of resources are provided by the instructor in order to be able to complete the exercises described in the following sections. The main objective of these resources is to provide a platform, multiple templates and other resources which are required to create different objects in Openshift.

Please review the following list to have an overall understanding of the resources provided for completing this tutorial:

- An Openshift cluster that will host and make available a set of applications deployed
- An ArgoCD installation that allows attendees to deploy applications in a GitOps fashion
- An Argo Rollouts installation that allows attendees to deploy applications using deployment strategies such as Blue/Green and Canary 
- A set of GitHub repositories that include the templates and automatisms required to deploy a group of applications
- https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies[GitHub - Cloud Native Deployment Strategies Repository]
