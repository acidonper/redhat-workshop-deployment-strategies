### Deploy Shop Application

TODO edit repo

We are going to create the application `shop`, that we will use to test Blue/Green deployment. Because we will make changes in the application's GitHub repository, we have to use the repository that you have just forked. Please edit the file `blue-green-argo-rollouts/application-shop-blue-green-rollouts.yaml` and set your own GitHub repository in the `reportURL`.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: shop-blue-green
  namespace: {user}-gitops-argocd
spec:
  destination:
    name: ''
    namespace: {user}-blue-green
    server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
  source:
    path: helm/quarkus-helm-umbrella/chart
    repoURL: https://github.com/change_me/shop-application-helm-chart
    targetRevision: HEAD
    helm:
      parameters:
      - name: "global.namespace"
        value: {user}-blue-green
      valueFiles:
        - values/vaues-blue-green.yaml
  project: default
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: false
      selfHeal: false
```
TODO is it right?
```
oc apply -f blue-green-argo-rollouts/application-shop-blue-green-rollouts.yaml
```

Looking at the Argo CD dashboard, you would notice that we have a new `shop` application.

TODO add image

### Test Shop application
 
We have deployed the `shop` with ArgoCD. We can test that it is up and running.
 
We have to get the Online route
```
curl "$(oc get routes products-umbrella-online -n {user}-blue-green --template='https://{{.spec.host}}')/products"
```
And the Offline route
```
curl "$(oc get routes products-umbrella-offline -n {user}-blue-green --template='https://{{.spec.host}}')/products"
```
Notice that in each microservice response we have added metadata information to see better the `version` of each application. This will help us to see the changes while we do the Blue/Green deployment.
Because right now we have both routers against the same rollout revision we will have the same response with version `v1.0.1`:

```json
{
   "products":[
      {
         ...
         "name":"TV 4K",
         "price":"1500€"
      }
   ],
   "metadata":{
      "version":"v1.0.1", <--
      "colour":"none",
      "mode":"online"
   }
}
```
### Initial status

To achieve Blue/Green deployment with `Cloud Native` applications using **Argo Rollouts**, we have designed this architecture.

This is our current status:
![Shop initial status](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/rollout-blue-green-step-0.png)

OpenShift Components - Online

- Routes and Services declared with the suffix -online
- Routes mapped only to the online services
- Services mapped to the rollout.
 
OpenShift Components - Offline

- Routes and Services declared with the suffix -offline
- Routes mapped only to the offline services
- Services mapped to the rollout

We can also see the rollout`s status[^note].

[^note]:
    Argo Rollouts offers a Kubectl plugin to enrich the experience with Rollouts https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/installation/#kubectl-plugin-installation 

```
kubectl argo rollouts get rollout products --watch -n {user}-blue-green
```

```

      └──□ products-67fc9fb79b-p7jk9  Pod         ✔ Running  12m  ready:1/1
```

We have defined an active or online service 'products-umbrella-online' and a preview or offline service 'products-umbrella-offline'. Final user will always use 'products-umbrella-online'. We have created an AnalysisTemplate 'products-analysis-template' that just validates the health of the application, for production environments a better analysis should be done. **Argo Rollouts** use this AnalysisTemplate to validate a new version and set whether it is ready to be promoted or not. To learn more, please read [this](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/features/bluegreen/).

```yaml
  strategy:
    blueGreen:
      activeService: products-umbrella-online
      previewService: products-umbrella-offline      
      autoPromotionEnabled: false
      prePromotionAnalysis:
        templates:
          - templateName: products-analysis-template
```
## Products Blue/Green deployment
We have split a `Cloud Native` Blue/Green deployment into two steps:

1. Deploy a new version.
2. Promote a new version
 

 
We have already deployed the products version v1.0.1, and we are ready to use a new products version v1.1.1 that has a new `description` attribute.

### Step 1 - Deploy a new version
 
 TODO is it the right path?
We will deploy a new version v1.1.1. To do it, we have to edit the file `helm/quarkus-helm-umbrella/chart/values/vaues-blue-green.yaml` under `products-blue` set `tag` value to `v.1.1.1`

```yaml
products-blue:
  mode: online
  image:
    tag: v1.1.1
```

And push the changes
```
git add .
git commit -m "Change products version to v1.1.1"
git push
```

 ArgoCD will refresh the status after some minutes. If you don't want to wait you can refresh it manually from ArgoCD UI or configure the Argo CD Git Webhook.[^note2].
 
[^note2]:
    Here you can see how to configure the Argo CD Git [Webhook]( https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/webhook/)
    ![Argo CD Git Webhook](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/ArgoCD-webhook.png)


![Refresh Shop](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/ArgoCD-Shop-Refresh.png)
 
**Argo Rollouts** will automatically deploy the new products version and execute the `prePromotionAnalysis`. 

```
NAME                                  KIND         STATUS        AGE  INFO

      └──□ products-67fc9fb79b-p7jk9  Pod          ✔ Running     27m  ready:1/1
```
  
If the `prePromotionAnalysis` goes well, we can see that offline applications have version v1.1.1 and the new attribute description, but the online version has not changed.

This is our current status:
![Shop Step 1](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/rollout-blue-green-step-1.png)

 
```json
{
  "products":[
     {
        "discountInfo":{...},
        "name":"TV 4K",
        "price":"1500€",
        "description":"The best TV" <--
     }
  ],
  "metadata":{
     "version":"v1.1.1", <--
  }
}
```
Functional testing users can execute `Smoke tests` to validate this new v1.1.1 version.

We have to be careful with those tests in a production environment because the product microservice will call the online dependencies.
If this dependency is for example a production DB we will create the things that our `Smoke tests` do.
 
### Step 2 - Promote a new version
 
We are going to open the new version to final users.

Execute this command to promote products:
```
kubectl argo rollouts promote products -n {user}-blue-green
```

First **Argo Rollouts** will just change the service to use the new release (ReplicaSet). We `minimize downtime` because it just changes the service label. 

```

```
This is our current status:
![Shop Step 2 initial](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/rollout-blue-green-step-2-initial.png)

And after `scaleDownDelaySeconds` **Argo Rollouts** will scale down the first replicaSet (v1.0.1).
 
```

```

This is our final status:
![Shop Step 2](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/rollout-blue-green-step-2.png)

**We have in the online environment the new version v1.1.1!!!**
```json
{
  "products":[
     {
        "discountInfo":{...},
        "name":"TV 4K",
        "price":"1500€",
        "description":"The best TV" <--
     }
  ],
  "metadata":{
     "version":"v1.1.1", <--
  }
}
```

### Rollback

Imagine that something goes wrong, we know that this never happens but just in case. We can do a very `quick rollback` just by undoing the change in the `Products` online service.

**Argo Rollouts** has an [undo](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/generated/kubectl-argo-rollouts/kubectl-argo-rollouts_undo/) command to do the rollback. In my opinion, I don't like this procedure because it is not aligned with GitOps. The changes that **Argo Rollouts** do does not come from git, so git is OutOfSync with what we have in Openshift.
In our case the commit that we have done not only changes the ReplicaSet but also the ConfigMap. The `undo` command only changes the ReplicaSet, so it does not work for us.

I recommend doing the changes in git. We will revert the last commit
```
git revert HEAD
git push
```
**ArgoCD** will get the changes and apply them. **Argo Rollouts** will create a new revision with the previous version.

![Shop Step Rollback initial](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/rollout-blue-green-step-rollback-initial.png)

Execute this command to promote products to version `v1.0.1`:
```
kubectl argo rollouts promote products -n {user}-blue-green
```
The rollback is done!

{
   "products":[
      {
         ...
         "name":"TV 4K",

      }
   ],
   "metadata":{
      "version":"v1.0.1", <--
      "colour":"none",
      "mode":"online"
   }
}
```
## Canary deployment strategy


A canary deployment is a strategy where the operator releases a new version of their application to a small percentage of the production traffic. This small percentage may test the new version and provide feedback. If the new version is working well the operator may increase the percentage, till all the traffic is using the new version. Unlike Blue/Green, canary deployments are smoother, and failures have limited impact. 

### Deploy Shop Application

TODO edit repo and file location


We are going to create the application `shop`, that we will use to test canary deployment. Because we will make changes in the application's GitHub repository, we have to use the repository that you have just forked. Please edit the file `canary-argo-rollouts/application-shop-canary-rollouts.yaml` and set your own GitHub repository in the `reportURL`.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: shop-canary
  namespace: {user}-gitops-argocd
spec:
  destination:
    name: ''
    namespace: {user}-canary
    server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
  source:
    path: helm/quarkus-helm-umbrella/chart
    repoURL: https://github.com/change_me/shop-application-helm-chart
    targetRevision: HEAD
    helm:
      parameters:
      - name: "global.namespace"
        value: {user}-canary
      valueFiles:
        - values/values-canary.yaml
  project: default
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: false
      selfHeal: false

```

```
oc apply -f canary-argo-rollouts/application-shop-canary-rollouts.yaml
```

Looking at the Argo CD dashboard, you would notice that we have a new `shop` application.

TODO add image

### Test Shop application
 
We have deployed the `shop` with ArgoCD. We can test that it is up and running.
 
We have to get the Online route
```
curl "$(oc get routes products-umbrella-online -n {user}-canary --template='https://{{.spec.host}}')/products"
```

Notice that in each microservice response we have added metadata information to see better the `version` of each application. This will help us to see the changes while we do the canary deployment.
We can see that the current version is `v1.0.1`:
```json
{
   "products":[
      {
         ...
         "name":"TV 4K",
         "price":"1500€"
      }
   ],
   "metadata":{
      "version":"v1.0.1", <--
      "colour":"none",
      "mode":"online"
   }
}
```

### Initial status

To achieve canary deployment with `Cloud Native` applications using **Argo Rollouts**, we have designed this architecture.

![Shop initial status](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/canary-rollout-step-0.png)

OpenShift Components - Online

- Routes and Services declared with the suffix -online
- Routes mapped only to the online services
- Services mapped to the rollout.

In Blue/Green deployment we always have an offline service to test the version that is not in production. In the case of canary deployment we do not need it because progressively we will have the new version in production. 


We can also see the rollout`s status[^note].


```
kubectl argo rollouts get rollout products --watch -n {user}-canary
```

```

      └──□ products-67fc9fb79b-xlkhp  Pod         ✔ Running  38s  ready:1/1
```

We have defined an active or online service 'products-umbrella-online'. Final user will always use 'products-umbrella-online'. When a new version is deployed **Argo Rollouts** create a new revision (ReplicaSet). The number of replicas in the new release increases based on the information in the steps, and the number of replicas in the old release decreases by the same number. We have configured a pause duration between each step. To learn more about **Argo Rollouts**, please read [this](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/features/canary/).

This is how we have configured **Argo Rollouts** strategy for this demo:
```yaml
  strategy:
    canary:
      steps:
        - setWeight: 10
        - pause:
            duration: 30s
        - setWeight: 50
        - pause:
            duration: 30s
```
TODO (improvement) uses Prometheus metrics

## Products canary deployment

We have split a `Cloud Native` Canary deployment into three automatic step:

1. Deploy canary version for 10%
2. Scale the canary version to 50%
3. Scale the canary version to 100%

This is just an example. The key point here is that very easily we can have the canary deployment that better fits our needs. To make this demo faster we have not set a pause without duration in any step, so  **Argo Rollouts** will go throw each step automatically.

### Step 1 - Deploy the canary version for 10%
 
We will deploy a new version v1.1.1. To do it, we have to edit the file `helm/quarkus-helm-umbrella/chart/values/values-canary.yaml` under `products-blue` set `tag` value to `v.1.1.1`

```yaml
products-blue:
  mode: online
  image:
    tag: v1.1.1
```

**Argo Rollouts** will automatically deploy a new products revision. The canary version will be 10% of the replicas. In this demo we are no using [traffic management](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/features/traffic-management/). **Argo Rollouts** makes a best-effort attempt to achieve the percentage listed in the last setWeight step between the new and old version. This means that it will create only one replica in the new revision because it is rounded up. All the requests are load balanced between the old and the new replicas.

Push the changes to start the deployment.
```
git add .
git commit -m "Change products version to v1.1.1"
git push
```

 ArgoCD will refresh the status after some minutes. If you don't want to wait you can refresh it manually from ArgoCD UI or configure the Argo CD Git Webhook.[^note2].
 
[^note2]:
    Here you can see how to configure the Argo CD Git [Webhook]( https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/webhook/)

      └──□ products-67fc9fb79b-xlkhp  Pod         ✔ Running  3m13s  ready:1/1
```

In the products URL response, you will have the new version in 25% of the requests.

New revision:
```json
{
  "products":[
     {
        "discountInfo":{...},
        "name":"TV 4K",
        "price":"1500€",
        "description":"The best TV" <--
     }
  ],
  "metadata":{
     "version":"v1.1.1", <--
  }
}
```

Old revision:
```json
{
  "products":[
     {
        "discountInfo":{...},
        "name":"TV 4K",
        "price":"1500€"
     }
  ],
  "metadata":{
     "version":"v1.0.1", <--
  }
}
```

### Step 2 - Scale the canary version to 50%
After 30 seconds **Argo Rollouts** automatically will increase the number of replicas in the new release to 2. Instead of increasing automatically after 30 seconds, we can configure **Argo Rollouts** to wait indefinitely until that `Pause` condition is removed. But this is not part of this demo.
This is our current status:

### Step 3 - Scale the canary version to 100%
After another 30 seconds, **Argo Rollouts** will increase the number of replicas in the new release to 4 and scale down the old revision.

**We have in the online environment the new version v1.1.1!!!**
```json
{
  "products":[
     {
        "discountInfo":{...},
        "name":"TV 4K",
        "price":"1500€",
        "description":"The best TV" <--
     }
  ],
  "metadata":{
     "version":"v1.1.1", <--
  }
}
```

### Rollback

Imagine that something goes wrong, we know that this never happens but just in case. We can do a very `quick rollback` just by undoing the change.

**Argo Rollouts** has an [undo](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/generated/kubectl-argo-rollouts/kubectl-argo-rollouts_undo/) command to do the rollback. In my opinion, I don't like this procedure because it is not aligned with GitOps. The changes that **Argo Rollouts** do does not come from git, so git is OutOfSync with what we have in Openshift.
In our case the commit that we have done not only changes the ReplicaSet but also the ConfigMap. The `undo` command only changes the ReplicaSet, so it does not work for us.

I recommend doing the changes in git. We will revert the last commit
```
git revert HEAD --no-edit
```

If we just revert the changes in git we will go back to the previous version. But **Argo Rollouts** will take this revert as a new release so it will do it throw the steps that we have configured. We want a `quick rollback` we don't want a step-by-step revert. To achieve the `quick rollback` we will configure **Argo Rollouts** without steps for the rollback.

Because we have our **Argo Rollouts** configuration as values in our Helm Chart, we have just to edit the values.yaml that we are using.

In the file `helm/quarkus-helm-umbrella/chart/values/values-canary.yaml` under `products-blue` under the `steps` delete all the steps and only set one step `- setWeight: 100`

`helm/quarkus-helm-umbrella/chart/values/values-canary.yaml` should looks like:
```yaml
products-blue:
  mode: online
  image:
    tag: v1.0.1
  version: none
  replicaCount: 4
  fullnameOverride: "products"
  rollouts:
    enabled: true
    canary:
      steps:
        - setWeight: 100
```

Execute those commands to push the changes:
```
git add .
git commit -m "delete steps for rollback"
git push
```
**ArgoCD** will get the changes and apply them. **Argo Rollouts** will create a new revision with the previous version.

The rollback is done!
![Shop Step Rollback](https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies/raw/main/images/canary-rollout-step-Rollback.png)
```json
{
  "products":[
     {
        "discountInfo":{...},
        "name":"TV 4K",
        "price":"1500€"
     }
  ],
  "metadata":{
     "version":"v1.0.1", <--
  }
}
```
To get the application ready for a new release we should configure again the  **Argo Rollouts** with the steps.
