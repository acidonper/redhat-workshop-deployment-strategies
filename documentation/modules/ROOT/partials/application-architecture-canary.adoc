## Application architecture

To achieve canary deployment with `Cloud Native` applications using **Argo Rollouts**, we have designed this architecture.

image::canary-rollout-step-0.png["Dstrategies initial status"]

OpenShift Components - Online

- Routes and Services declared with the suffix -online
- Routes mapped only to the online services
- Services mapped to the rollout.

In Blue/Green deployment we always have an offline service to test the version that is not in production. In the case of canary deployment we do not need it because progressively we will have the new version in production. 


We can also see the rollout`s status.

This is how we have configured **Argo Rollouts** strategy for this demo, you can check it here `helm/helm-umbrella-dstrategies/chart/values/canary/values-rollouts-strategy.yaml`

We have defined an active or online service 'dstrategies-back-online'. Final user will always use 'dstrategies-back-online'. When a new version is deployed **Argo Rollouts** create a new revision (ReplicaSet). The number of replicas in the new release increases based on the information in the steps, and the number of replicas in the old release decreases by the same number. We have configured a pause duration between each step. To learn more about **Argo Rollouts**, please read _https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/features/canary/_.
