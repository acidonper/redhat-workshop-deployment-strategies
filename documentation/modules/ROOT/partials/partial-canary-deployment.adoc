## Deploy Dstrategies Application

We are going to create the application `dstrategies`, that we will use to test canary deployment {service-mesh}. Because we will make changes in the application's GitHub repository, we have to use the repository that you have just forked. Please edit the following yaml and set your own GitHub repository in the `reportURL`. Create a file called {file}

Looking at the Argo CD dashboard, you would notice that we have a new `dstrategies` application.

## Test Dstrategies application
 
We have deployed the `dstrategies` with ArgoCD. We can test that it is up and running.
 
We have to get the Online route
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl "$(oc get routes {route}"
----

Notice that in each microservice response we have added metadata information to see better the `version` of each application. This will help us to see the changes while we do the canary deployment.
We can see that the current version is `V1.0.0`:


## Dstrategies-back canary deployment {service-mesh}

We have split a `Cloud Native` Canary deployment into three automatic step:

1. Deploy canary version for 10%
2. Scale the canary version to 50%
3. Scale the canary version to 100%

This is just an example. The key point here is that very easily we can have the canary deployment that better fits our needs. To make this demo faster we have not set a pause without duration in any step, so  **Argo Rollouts** will go throw each step automatically.

To test canary deployment we are going to do changes in the backend application dstrategies-back.

### Step 1 - Deploy the canary version for 10%
 
We will deploy a new version V2.0.0. To do it, we have to edit the file `helm/helm-umbrella-dstrategies/chart/values/{namespace}/values-image-tag.yaml` under `dstrategies-back` set `tag` value to `V2.0.0`

[source,input,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
dstrategies-back:
   image:
     tag: V2.0.0
----

include::partial$traffic-management-{namespace}.adoc[]

Push the changes to start the deployment.
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Change dstrategies-back version to V2.0.0"
git push
----

ArgoCD will refresh the status after some minutes. If you don't want to wait you can refresh it manually from ArgoCD UI.

image::argocd-Dstrategies-{namespace}-Refresh.png["Refresh Dstrategies"]

This is our current status:

----
kubectl argo rollouts get rollout dstrategies-back --watch -n {user}-{namespace}
----

include::partial$rollout-step1-{namespace}.adoc[]


TODO chang to front image
In the dstrategies-back URL response, you will have the new version in 25% of the requests.

New revision:


Old revision:


### Step 2 - Scale the canary version to 50%
After 60 seconds **Argo Rollouts** automatically will increase the number of replicas in the new release to 2. Instead of increasing automatically after 60 seconds, we can configure **Argo Rollouts** to wait indefinitely until that `Pause` condition is removed. But this is not part of this demo.
This is our current status:

----
kubectl argo rollouts get rollout dstrategies-back --watch -n {user}-{namespace}
----

include::partial$rollout-step2-{namespace}.adoc[]

You can see in the TODOaddfrontURL[Front] how the version and the color are changing.

### Step 3 - Scale the canary version to 100%
After another 60 seconds, **Argo Rollouts** will increase the number of replicas in the new release to 4 and scale down the old revision.

This is our current status:

**We have in the online environment the new version V2.0.0!!!**

TODO chang to front image


### Rollback

Imagine that something goes wrong, we know that this never happens but just in case. We can do a very `quick rollback` just by undoing the change.

**Argo Rollouts** has an https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/generated/kubectl-argo-rollouts/kubectl-argo-rollouts_undo/[undo] command to do the rollback. In our opinion, we don't like this procedure because it is not aligned with GitOps. The changes that **Argo Rollouts** do does not come from git, so git is OutOfSync with what we have in Openshift.
In our case the commit that we have done not only changes the ReplicaSet but also the ConfigMap. The `undo` command only changes the ReplicaSet, so it does not work for us.

I recommend doing the changes in git. We will revert the last commit
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git revert HEAD --no-edit
----

If we just revert the changes in git we will go back to the previous version. But **Argo Rollouts** will take this revert as a new release so it will do it throw the steps that we have configured. We want a `quick rollback` we don't want a step-by-step revert. To achieve the `quick rollback` we will configure **Argo Rollouts** without steps for the rollback.

Because we have our **Argo Rollouts** configuration as values in our Helm Chart, we have just to edit the values.yaml that we are using.

In the file `helm/helm-umbrella-dstrategies/chart/values/{namespace}/values-rollouts-strategy.yaml` under `dstrategies-back` under the `steps` delete all the steps and only set one step `- setWeight: 100`

`helm/helm-umbrella-dstrategies/chart/values/{namespace}/values-rollouts-strategy.yaml` should looks like:


include::partial$values-rollouts-strategy-{namespace}.adoc[]

Execute those commands to push the changes:

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "delete steps for rollback"
git push
----

**ArgoCD** will get the changes and apply them. **Argo Rollouts** will create a new revision with the previous version.

The rollback is done!

TODO chang to front image


To get the application ready for a new release we should configure again the  **Argo Rollouts** with the steps.
