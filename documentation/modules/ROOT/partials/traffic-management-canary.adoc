**Argo Rollouts** will automatically deploy a new dstrategies-back revision. The canary version will be 10% of the replicas. In this demo we are no using [traffic management](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/features/traffic-management/). **Argo Rollouts** makes a best-effort attempt to achieve the percentage listed in the last setWeight step between the new and old version. This means that it will create only one replica in the new revision because it is rounded up. All the requests are load balanced between the old and the new replicas.
